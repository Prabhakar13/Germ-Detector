# Germ-Detector
An APF based simulation of Germs over Masked/Un-masked person.

It uses OpenCV and Pre-Trained Deep Learning Model, to recognize whether
a person in the camera frame is wearing a mask or not. It then simulates
the motion of randomly generated germs scattered in air, according to the
flag whether the person has worn a mask or not, where the movement of the
germs is comtrolled by Aritificial Potential Field.

This was a mini-project being done as a part of the Artificial Life
Simulation Course, attended under Dr. Rahul Kala.
